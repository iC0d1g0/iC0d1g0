## General details about me

I‚Äôm a passionate technology professional with a unique blend of creativity and logic, always looking for new adventures and challenges that keep my mind active and motivated. My proactive personality makes me a calculated innovator and skeptical and curious. I usually question, analyze and seek to understand even the smallest detail. I deeply value education and respect in interpersonal relationships, and although I‚Äôm emotionally stable in order to understand complex situations and changes, this drives me to be even more responsible and consideration of others.

I enjoy socializing and sharing knowledges with others. I love teaching. I feel happy by helping others to learn step by step new technologies.
 Building strong habits, which I maintain with discipline. My focus on self-discipline allows me to turn curiosity and fun into productivity and personal growth.
